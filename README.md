Start Ultimately this will epoch, the goal of active investment management is to generate Alpha, defined as when investment managers say “our goal is to generate alpha,” they are basically saying that the goal is to generate a higher return while assuming a similar amount of risk as compared to the benchmark against which they measure their performance. portfolio returns in excess of the benchmark used for evaluation. The fundamental law of active management postulates that the key to generating alpha is having accurate return forecasts combined with the ability to act on these forecasts (Grinold 1989; Grinold and Kahn 2000).

It defines the information ratio (IR) to express the value of active management as the ratio of the return difference between the portfolio and a benchmark to the volatility of those returns. It further approximates the IR as the product of

The information coefficient (IC), which measures the quality of forecast as their rank correlation with the outcomes The square root of the breadth of a strategy expressed as the number of independent bets on these forecasts

Im not really sure how i am going to do it, but with my market experience I am going to make something and develop a viable product
